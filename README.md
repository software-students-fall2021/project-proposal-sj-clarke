# Project Proposal

Proposal by: Sarah-Jane Clarke, Gal Ben-Shushan, Elizabeth Jiranek

### Project Title
TripSplit

### What and why?
Some of the best memories are created on vacation with friends, but who wants to deal with the time consuming and tedious tasks of back and forth payments of expenses and scheduling? TripSplit is an all-in-one platform to consolidate traveler’s expenses and eliminate the stresses of traveling.

### For whom?
This platform is for large groups of English speaking travelers of any age, but can also be used on smaller scale cases on a day-to-day basis. 

### How?
In order for a user to begin using this web application, they must create an account. Once logged in, users will be able to create a trip, which they can add friends who also have TripSplit accounts to or their friends can join from their end. Once a trip is created, all users who have access to this trip can create, delete, and edit payments. When a trip is first created, each member of the group will have 0 balances due. However, when payments begin to be created and split between members of the group, balances will be created for each person within the group that the user owes money to. For example, if I was on a trip with 5 my friends and one person named Sarah covered dinner for $500. After dinner Sarah will create this payment on her TripSplit account, input $500 as the total payment, add all 4 of us to the payment, and once the payment has been created, under our balances we will see a new entry that says we owe Sarah $100. These balances will constantly be updated as new payments are created or even deleted throughout the trip. 

*Additional features:*
Scheduling section to plan out activities, flights, reservations that will occur during the trip
Multiple people pay, 6 people trip (3 pay, 3 owe) 

### Scope
This project is very flexible. If we want to make it more complex we can, or we can make it more simplified if we don’t have time to meet all of our more complex ideas. Our main focus is developing the following components: user login, payment and profile management, and scheduling functionality. With 5 programmers with front end and back end development experience we can apply what we know as well as what we learn in this course to complete this project on time.
